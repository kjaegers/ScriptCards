Change Log for items in the ScriptExamples/dnd5e Folder:

2024-05-25
- 5E Action Menu 2.6.0 adds support for a library called "ActionMenuAddons", which can define functions that will be executed at various points in the action menu processing. This is the initial implementation and includes a handful of triggers (PCPostCantripCastFunction, PCPostSpellCastFunction, PCPostAttackFunction, and NPCPostAttackFunction). This will be expanded over time. To use this functinality, create a handout called "ScriptCards Library ActionMenuAddons" (case sensitive) and see the ActionMenuAddons library in the GitHub for an example.

2024-04-29 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.5.1
             - Removed magic damage bonus from secondary damage types on weapons, as it was being added to both damage types.

2024-03-03 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.5.0
             - First run at improving the execution speed of the script by utilizing the new benchmarking features in ScriptCards 2.7.0
             - Cleaned out some commented out items
             - ScriptCards 2.6.6b (now the necessary version of the API) fixes the issue with setting toggles that haven't been set manually.

2024-01-01 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.4.6a
             - Bug fix

2024-01-01 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.4.6
             - Bug fixes for NPC spellcasting when tracking spell slots, and fixed a bad forumla to calculate available slots

2023-05-04 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.4.5
             - Fix for NPC action names that include a semicolon

2023-02-20 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.4.4
             - Fix the two different shared macro mules having the same variable name.

2023-02-20 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.4.3
             - NPC Actions that are attacks, and PC Attacks now also get a repeat button in the title area.
             - If any player besides the original script runner tries to use the repeat button, they will be told they
               can't do that.6

2023-02-20 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.4.2
             - Non-scaling cantrips will now have a "repeat" button added to the title box, to allow them to easily be cast in
               quick succession. A new target will be prompted each time.

2023-02-20 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.4.1
             - New array defined in settings: NonScalingCantrips. By default this contains Eldritch Blast, which will prevent
               the cantrip from automatically scaling damage, since each bolt of an Eldritch Blast is a separate attack/damage roll.

2023-02-20 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.4.0
             - The title area now uses icons from game-icons.net for settings, short rest and long rest buttons set 
               useGameIconsGraphicsForTitleButtons to 0 to disable
             - Table-ized the character summary area and improved the look. There is a new setting (useGameIconsGraphics)
               that can be used to replace "AC", "HP", and "SPEED" with game-icons.net icons if set to 1 (off by default)
             - Combined the Skill/Save and the Advantage Mode into a single line to save space
             - Table-ized the Global Modifiers to take up less space and to make them more visually appealing.
             - Proper HP detection for NPCs in the character summary
             - Uses the new [p] features of SC 2.2.9, so upgrade for best results

2023-02-20 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.4.0
             - Incorporated Will M.'s code to add Bonus Actions and Reactions to the action menu. Default to on, set with 
               showBonusActionsAndReactions to 0 to disable
             - Did a little reorganization of the options area to group options that enable/diable parts of the menu together

2023-02-20 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.3.8
             - Cantrips should be fixed. Really this time.

2023-02-20 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.3.7
             - Performance enhancement for characters with large spellbooks. Generating buttons for spells while performing spell
               prepared checks is now MUCH faster (my test character with over 100 spells creates the action menu in 20 seconds in
               v 2.3.6 and in under 5 in 2.3.7)

2023-02-19 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.3.6
             - Bug fixes for missing cantrips output and for prepared spells check not working properly.

2023-02-19 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.3.5
             - Bug fix to remove default setting to use emojis in the character summary area

2023-02-18 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.3.4
             - You can use the description field of a weapon attack (center column of the character sheet) to specify audio and video
               effects to play along with the attack. The format for this is a single line that contains the effect specifiers with either
               "vfx:" for visual effects or "sfx:" for sound effects. One of each can be specified by separating the values with a $
               Example:
                  vfx:burst-blood$sfx:ArrowHit
               The order of the specifiers doesn't matter. VFX are point-based only at this time, and default to playing on the target. 
               If you add "s " in front of the specifier (like "vfx:s burst-magic") the effect will play on the source token instead of 
               the target. This is an experimental feature, and I'll likely add this same option to NPCs and potentially spells if I can 
               find appropriate places to put the text that isn't too difficult to edit. This may also potentially be moved off to A
               mule that can hold this information by attack/action/spell name depending on how this works out.

2023-02-01 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.3.3
             - Bug fixes for some advantage/disadvantage conflict resolution
             - New spell tags (after the name in the button) : [RA] = Reaciont, [BA] = Bonus Action, [C] = Concentration. Multiple modifiers
               will be appended together as applicable.
             - Toned down the default colors to be less bright
             - Added Character Race and Speed to the character summary, and split it across two lines
             - New config parameter: "UseEmojisToReplaceText" if set to 1 will replace "AC", "HP", and "SPEED" in the character summary with
               emojis to represent the attributes

2023-01-28 - 5E Character Action menu 2.3.1
             - Bug fix for determining the attribute modifier for damage rolls. I normally would not impact anything, since the damage attribute
               is almost always the same as the attack attribute, but if you had set it differently (or, as Will M. pointed out, have it blank
               for an off-hand attack) it was trying to use a non-existent repeating field for the lookup.

2022-12-31 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.3.0
             - Extensive changes to the implementation of the script, including the emilination of redundant code by refactoring reusable code
               into subroutines for displaying button lists. This will make updating the script to work with other character sheets 
               simpler, as the code that calls the button generator can be updated with the names of the repeating sections to parse. Implemention
               sections (EXEC_NPC_ACTION, etc. will likely still need to be rewritten for each sheet, however) it should also be noted that
               there is still quite a bit of work underway to restructure the Action Menu, and testing is needed to verify that these changes
               have not negatively impacted existing functionality.
             - Ritual spells will now have "As Ritual" as the default choice for spell level when cast, and will appear on the spell list and
               are castable even if the character has no spell slots available. Casting a spell as a ritual does not consume a spell slot if
               tracking player spell slots
             - Added NPC and PC Abilities Mule support, which works just like the Spell Mule. This is potentially less useful, however, as the variation
               in NPC/PC abilities is quite high. There may be some cases where it is helpful, however.
             - Cleaned up the Custom Actions code to prevent "false" being displayed under custom actions for characters that didn't have any.
             - Cleaned up instances where a space was displayed after an opening bracket in a roll notation (ie, [ INT] instead of [INT])

2022-11-29 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.2.2
             - Added support for additional ability buttons defined on a per-character basis. If you create abilities on character sheets
               starting with "AM-", the action menu will create buttons for them at the end of the menu card. The AM- will be removed from
               the name, dashes will be converted to spaces, and the button list will be alphabetized.

2022-11-24 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.2.1
             - Fixes the support for token-marker based modifiers introduced in 2.1.6. There were some issues depending on what kind of token
               the target vs attacker was.

2022-11-07 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.2.0
             - Adds support for the template functionality added in ScriptCards 2.2.0. Default template is "none". Setting &Template in the settings
               area allows you to specify any available template.
             - Removed leading spaces from button displays and put them at the end of the button for better visual display

2022-09-20 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.1.6
             - The sendGmInfo setting now masks the AC for all attack rolls and also sends the GM an output line detailing the attack.
             - Updated the Spell Mule code the use buttons by name instead of character ID to work around a bug in Roll20's late-loading system. It
               should no longer be necessary to open the Spell Mule character sheet before using the Action Menu now.
             - Two new array definition in the settings area allow you to specify items on the Attack & Spellcasting section of the character sheet that
               should be displayed in the PC Attacks section even if they are spells. The examples already there is Spiritual Weapon, which allows the
               player to use the Spell button to cast the weapon, and then use the PC Attacks button to make an attack with the weapon on subsequent
               turns without expending a spell slot, and Scorching Ray with allows the rays after the first to be cast from PC Attacks also without
               expending spell slots. There is no "enforcement" of this secondary casting - it is just a convenience option.
             - New setting section : useTokenMakersForNPCModifiers. If set to 1 you can define the impact of token markers on NPCs. The following modifiers 
               are supported:
                 attack:value        (use +X [Desc] to provide a value and description, Can be -X as well) 
                 damage:value        (use +X [Desc] to provide a value and description, Can be -X as well)
                 rollmode:mode       (use d for disadvantage, a for advantage, n for normal)
                 attackermode:mode   (use d for disadvantage, a for advantage, n for normal)
                 ac:value            (use +X [Desc] to provide a value and description, Can be -X as well) 
                 resist:dmgtypes     (use - to separate damage types, ex bludgeoning-slashing-piercing)
                 immune:dmgtypes     (use - to separate damage types, ex bludgeoning-slashing-piercing)
                 vuln:dmgtypes       (use - to separate damage types, ex bludgeoning-slashing-piercing)

2022-09-15 - 5E Character Action menu 2.1.5
             - Added new configuration parameters SpellsToKeepWithSuffix and SpellsToKeepNoSuffix. These are arrays that list the names of spells
               that, if listed in a characters Attacks & Spellcasting area, will be left in the PC Attacks section (as well as the spells list). This
               is useful for spells that continue to deal damage over time (Spiritual Weapon, for example) without the need to expend another spell
               slot.

2022-08-20 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.1.4
             - Added support for Global Skill Mods and made global AC and global Skill mod buttons optional in the per-char config menu

2022-08-29 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.1.3
             - Adds support for Global AC modifiers

2022-08-18 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.1.2
             - Added support for Short/Long rests as buttons in the subtitle area of the action menu. A long rest is more or less a single click, while
               a short rest will bring up a new menu allowing the player to spend hit dice. Warlock packt spells are recovered on a short rest, while a 
               long rest will recover all HP and spell slots. Can be disabled by changing &ShowRestButtons to 0 in the settings area.
             - Removed the default "snail" marker for concentration since it was only there for testing :) You can set a marker in the settings area
               to be applied to tokens when they cast a concentration spell.
             - Incorporated the newly written status marker support functions to make dealing with status markers more reliable. The only interaction
               with them (for now) is setting a concentration marker.

2022-08-18 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.1.1
             - Fix for a bug introduced in 2.1.0 that broke toggling gloal modifier states on/off

2022-08-17 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.1.0
             - New option : DetectPlayersToken. If set to 1, the players will not need to select a token manually as long as they control a single
               token on the current Player Page (ribbon page) when executing the Action Menu macro
             - Removed the &#64;{ target masking approach to hiding the target info from Roll20. The old way I was doing it meant that nothing about
               the macro could be edited in the macro editor or the script would prompt for a target becuse Roll20 would screw up the HTML replacements.
               The new method builds a ScriptCards string to substitute for the replacement sequence, which doesn't break when the macro editor is
               reopened on the macro.

2022-08-07 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.0.12
             - Added the ability to set a status marker when casting spells that require concentration. Set the ConcentrationMarkerName value in the settings
               area to the name of the marker you wish to set when a concentration spell is cast. Note that Spell_Mule spells will need to handle this 
               functionality on their own, as they are not processed by the Action Menu.

2022-08-05 - 5E Character Action menu 2.0.11
             - Damage resistance/vulnerability/immunity now attempts to check for special cases like Silver, Adamant, and Magical damage
             - Bug fix in whispering saving throws to the appropriate targets.
             - Other smaller bug fixes.

2022-07-17 - 5E Magic Missile 2.2
             Exclusively uses ScriptCards to apply damage, since using token-mod or alterbars will only apply damage from one missile if a target is
             selected more than once (order/timing of execution of the scripts gets in the way).

2022-07-09 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.0.5
             NOTE: This is a major update to the 5E Character Action Menu, and requires the absolute latest version of ScriptCards (2.0.2g at the 
             time of this writing) for all of its features to be supported.
           - Adds checks for damage immunity, vulnerability, and resistances when making attacks or casting spells against NPCs. Currently, I don't 
             see a method for adding this information to the character sheet for PCs - If I'm missing where it is, please let me know :) Attacks that do 
             multiple damage types are handled appropriately based on the type of each damage roll.
           - Implements a per-character options system. Right now, the configuration options are limited to toggling on or off the display of the global 
             modifier buttons and the saves/skills buttons. This is more of a groundwork thing for future modifications. A button will appear in the title 
             bar of the main Action Menu that looks like a small gear. Clicking this will display the customization menu for that character. Options are 
             stored on the character in a new attribute called 5ECAM_SETTINGS.
             
2022-07-05 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.0.1 - Spell Prep checks are now skipped for Warlocks in addition to Sorcerers.

2022-07-04 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.0.0 
             - Changed the defaults for some of the optional features to enable them. Please check these settings before upgrading and customize as needed
             - Tweaked the colors and theme slightly to improve the default appearance of the menus. 
             - Added Global Save Modifiers toggle buttons. 
             - Added "Skill Check" and "Saving Throw" buttons to the main action menu. Can be enabled/disabled for PCs and NPCs separately in settings. These
               saving throws will take global save modifiers that are currently enable into account.
             - Used the new 2.0.2d buttonpadding setting to alter the size of the buttons on the menu, making the global modifier buttons considerably smaller.
               Both the standard buttons and the small button sizes are customizable in the settings area.
             - Modified the self-handle advantage mode to show the current advantage mode by colorizing the appropriate button instead of printing the text.
             - Added option (on by default) to use a more compact display mode for the "Global X Saves" sections.

2022-05-28 - 5E Character Action Menu 1.9.0 - In response to a forum request by user John D., the Action Menu now includes support for toggling Global
             attack and damage modifiers on or off right from the action menu. If &showGlobalModifierButtons is set to 1 in the settings area (as with
             most/all new features, it is off by default), the action menu will display a summary of the character's defined Global Attack and Global
             Damage modifiers as buttons at the top of the menu. Active modifiers will have green buttons, while inactive modifiers will have red buttons.
             Clicking one of the buttons will toggle that modifier and redisplay the menu. NOTE: There is a wierdness/bug in Roll20 that can prevent
             setting attributes via the API that have never been initialized on the character sheet. This means that these buttons won't be able to toggle
             on a modifier that has never been toggled on from the character sheet. Manually toggling a modifier on and off once should fix this permanently.
             There were also a couple of small font/style changes to make things (especially for characters with lots of abilities) look a bit nicer.

2022-05-25 - 5E Character Action Menu. Thanks to JustinG for catching that spell names with more than one space in them wouldn't be found on a spell mule.
             Updated the code to allow this to work.

2022-04-18 - 5E Character Action Script - Added the ability to (optionally, of course) track and enforce spell slot limits for PCs. If trackPCSpellSlots is set
             to 1 in the configuraiton section, available spell slots will be used to determine which buttons are displayed on the action menu for spells. It 
             also determines which levels are available from the casting menu when the player clicks a spell button. If the player scrolls back up and tries to
             re-cast from a previously generated action menu and chooses a slot level they no longer have a slot for, they will receive a whispered message
             telling them that they are out of slots for that level. If spell slot tracking is turned on, by default a table of available spell slots is displayed
             above the spellcasting buttons on the menu. This can be turned off by setting showPCSpellSlotList to 0.

2022-03-04 - 5E Themed Macro Button Menu Template 1.0.0 - New script sample that uses a macro mule and a few attributes to generate 5E themed (in display only...
             the script is actually not system-specific) menu of buttons to click the various macros. The macros can be anything that can be placed on a character's
             ability page, including other ScriptCards scripts.

2022-03-04 - 5E Character Action Menu 1.8.1 - Bug fix for healing spells applying damage instead of healing :)

2022-02-27 - 5E Character Action Menu 1.8.0 - Added the "damagebuttons" option and two related options to the settings area. If damage apply type is set to
             "damagebuttons", instead of automatic damage application a row of four buttons will be added to the end of the card or whispered to the DM. Clicking
             these buttons will apply Full, Half, Quarter or Healing damage to the token(s) selected when the button is clicked. This feature requires ScriptCards
             version 1.6.4a or higher.

2022-02-25 - Added another version of 5E Initiative that is fully commented with explanations on what everything in the script does. Functionally it is the same
             as the existing version of the script.

2022-02-24 - 5E Initiative (1.0) - A script to roll initiative for one or more selected tokens and add them to the turn tracker.

2022-02-19 - 5E Dragon Breath (1.5.6) - Updated to include dragon types from Fizban's Treasury of Dragons. Option settings for what type of saves to use.

2022-01-31 - 5E Character Action Menu (1.7.6) - Code efficiency improvements, now takes custom crit damage into account if used.

2022-01-31 - 5E Character Action Menu (1.7.5) - Fixed bugs related to critical hit detection and use of character attributes for attack/damage rolls.
               REQUIRES ScriptCards 1.5.8+

2022-01-27 - 5E Character Action Menu (1.7.2) - Added Global Damage Modifier support. Added support for damage application (See settings area). Default
             is to NOT attempt to apply damage. Note that resistances, etc. are not currently figured into damage calculations. Renamed file on the repo 
             as a .roll20 file so I can use Andreas J.'s Roll20 syntax hilighter for Visual Studio Code (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anduh.rmacro)

2022-01-10 - 5e Burning Hands (1.6) - Added support for direct object modification for damage application. Added definable sound effect to play.
             5e Lightning Bolt (1.4) - Added support for direct object modification for damage application. Added definable sound effect to play. Corrected offset VFX.
             5e Dragonborn Breath (1.5) - Added support for direct object modification for damage application. Added definable sound effect to play. Corrected offset VFX.
             5e Magic Missile (2.1) - - Added support for direct object modification for damage application. Added definable sound effect to play.
             5e Character Action Menu (1.7.1) - Added logic to apply proficiency bonus even if the character sheet has not properly set the atkprofflag attribute.

2022-01-02 - 5e Burning Hands (1.5) - Added logic to ensure damage is applied in the correct direction (ie, not healing).
           - 5e Character Action Menu (1.7.0) - NPC Spellcasting can now be set to be whispered to sender by setting AllNPCActionsToSender to 1
